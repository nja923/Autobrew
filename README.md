# Autobrew
This is the code (arduino and processing) for the Autobrew project by Nick Anderson

This project will be done in two steps.  The first step will be to create a processing file that will display each individual component to be used on the project and allow the user to command or visually see each of them and what they are doing.  this will allow us to fine tune the actual brewing process to make sure we will be doing what we want, and when we want to.

The second step of the project will be to allow the users to input temperatures and times, and allow the arduino or processing file to then step through the process of the brew process.  This will allow the user to just set up the process, press play, and walk away.
