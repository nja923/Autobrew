Add processing file.  This file displays toggle buttons on the screen that allow on/off control of all ball valves and all power relays.
The file also displays all of the temperature sensors and the flow sensors for display to the user.

File takes status of the buttons and transmits them over serial, baud rate 115200, to the physical controller (arduino) to control the ball valves.
The transmit message format can be found in the Message Breakdown.xlsx file.  This will show what the first character the arduino should be looking for, and what it means

Next steps.
1. create serial message parsing in arduino controller to handle parsing the messages sent from processing.
2. Design arduino controller software to control individual ball valves and power relays based on serial message values.
3. Verify proper reading of temperature sensors and flow sensors in arduino
4. transmit temperature sensors and flow sensor outputs to processing via serial, baud rate 115200.
5. Create serial message parsing in processing controller to handle parsing the messages sent from arduino for temperature sensors and flow sensors.
